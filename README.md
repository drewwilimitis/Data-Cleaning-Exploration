# Exploratory Analysis, Data Cleaning, and Association Rule Mining in R

### Electronic Health Record Data  
Significantly improved the quality of pharmaceutical dosage data by parsing several fields, performing various transformations, extensively matching large numbers of unique cases for the frequency/method of drug administration, and gathering the most accurate outside data sources documented in the medical/industry literature.

### Association Rules in R  
Implementation of FPGrowth algorithm to mine the complete set of frequent patterns within pharmaceutical drug administration data, and then assign association rules to improve the accuracy of drug indications. Validated performance advantage compared to the conventional usage of the apriori algorithm in R. 

### Harvard Systems Medicine Data
